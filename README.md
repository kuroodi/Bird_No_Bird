# Bird Chirp Detector

This project is an audio based anomaly detector that uses deep learning to determine whether or not a bird chriped in a given audio file. The data consists of 20K raw audio files sourced from the BirdVox project(collaboration between Cornell and NYU). Each file is a simple 10 second audio clip recocrded by remote audio monitoring devices placed throughout a forest near Ithaca, NY.
